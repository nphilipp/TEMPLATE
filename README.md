# TEMPLATE module

A simple example of how module git repo could look like. This paragraph contains a short description of the module.

## Current state

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✓ YES | **Build passes** in the infra |
| ✗ NO  | **No bootstrap** - uses only proper modules |
| ✓ YES | General **Tests in dist-git** |
| ✓ YES | General **Tests pass** |
| ✗ NO  | Meets the **Fedora Packaging Guideline** |

### Notes

I can type some quick notes about the current state here. Like "I'm using bootstrap because I need Java to build my webserver and I didn't manage to get Java module to work."
